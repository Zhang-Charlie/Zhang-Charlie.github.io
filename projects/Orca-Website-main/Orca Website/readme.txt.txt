I tested my websites functionality across three popular browsers, the three browsers I used was Firefox, Google Chome and Microsoft Edge. 

1. For the first test I tested the links by clicking all the links on the navagation bar and checking if they all work as intended.
2. For the second test I tested the Responsive Web Design by going into the mobile view and desktop view.
3. For the third test I tested the link on the logo image, I did this by going into about.html and contact.html and clicking the logo to see if it will bring you to the index.html.
4. For the fourth test I tested embedded multimedia application in the About.html page, I clicked on the youtube video to see if it plays.

I did not encounter any functional issues tested and problems/glitches
